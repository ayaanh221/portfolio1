# H1 Ayaan's portfolio
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
The project i worked on is a portfolio about me and what i do. In my portfolio there are 5 detailed sctions that explains what i do and who i am.
A live demo can be found here.....

## h2 UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

my main audiance target are Employers that ar lookin for a full stack  developer that  can make both front and back nd website. I made my portfolio very easy for the employers 
use also it is a fully responsie website so hey can vew it from any devise,it has a very simple yet very profesional look.
 I have put a section called contact wheRE any one can contact me if they feel like my skills would be useful for them.
There is a section called about on the about page i made it ery clear for employers to know that i am a full stack developer that can creat both front and back end websites,
I have also added my CV so they  can know  my work history in depth.As a user type, I want to make my website very easy to understand, so that when people view my website they dont have any trouble to get around and ubderstand what i deliverd in the website.
 There is also an about page which explains who i am and what i do it also has a picture of me in this section the reason o addd the picture is so that the viewer knows who i am.
## h2 Features
This website uses a full navigation that goes across the page horizontally only when your viewing it on a desktop and when you view it on a mobile phone the navigaton bar automatically 
turns in to a scroll spy, to do this i used bootstrap and a bit of jquary to smooth it out
## h3 Features Left to Implement
In the future i would like to implement a section called projects in his sction i would include all my projects i have created throught my coding career, i would also add
a chat box so who ever has any question about my website for me can hae a chat over text with me all in my website.

### H3 Technologies

1. HTML this is where i put all the information that i want people who view my website to see.
2. CSS this is where i style all my html so i can attract the iew when looking an=t my website
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1) i used bootstrap to get the layout that i am looking for.
4. jquary  this project uses jquary to simplyfu DOM manipulations


## h2 Testing
I belive that i achied to showcase my portfolio in a wasy that employers and viewers would undersatnd who i am and what id do very easily with the information that i hae provided.
In the about section i have put a picture of my self so vie can imaging what i look like while they read about me i belie this would help them uderstand who i am more. The picture 
can only be viwed on a desktop only.
On this section i also wro wo paragraphs brifly exaplaing who i am, my background, what i do and what i intent to achive.
In the footer i put my social media, viewers ha to click on the social media icons his would lad he o another tab whre my social media open up in.
I put a section called cv this take you to another tab where my cv open up in employers/viewers can download my cv by clicking the document icons.

I can be contacted fron the contact section whe you would find a form that you can fill in. On the form if you write an inalid email you would get a small message identifying this mistack 
the message would say "inalid email " when filling the form out on a mobile devise and you want to write your phone numbr it would open up a number dialin board whre you can dial in your phone number
When you click on the links on he navbar the scroll spy effect would work regardless of wheather or not your viewing he section in the same order they are listed in he dropdown.

I tested this website across a few browsers (chrome, firefox, safari and internet explore), i ha also tested it on diffrent devise and sizes eg;- iphone XR; Iphone 6, samsung 1 plus
ipad and a macbook pro.
the diffrent sizes i viewed it on are (ipad 768 x1024) iphone xr(375 x 814) and laptop (1280 x 800)

while i was doin the tests i relised my picture was being squashed on the mobile devise so i decided to add a media quary and only veiw the picture on a desktop.

## h2 Deployment
 i deployed his site directly from a master branch and i used Git hub to host it. the landing page must be index.html for it to be deployed correctly.
 to run my code locally you would have to put the following in to your terminal ;- 'git commit'  (https://ayaanh221.github.io/portfolio1/)
