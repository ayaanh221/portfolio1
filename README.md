#  Ayaan's portfolio
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
The project i worked on is a portfolio about me and what i do.
In my portfolio there are 5 detailed sctions that explains what i do and who i am.
A live demo can be found [here]( https://ayaanh221.github.io/portfolio1/)

##  UX
 

my main audiance target are Employers that are looking for a full stack  developer that  can make both front and back end website. I made my portfolio very easy for the employers to use also it is a fully responsive website so they can view it from any device,
it has a very simple yet very profesional structure.
 I have put a section called contact wheRE any one can contact me if they feel like my skills would be useful for them.
There is a section called about on the about page i made it ery clear for employers to know that i am a full stack developer that can creat both front and back end websites,
I have also added my CV so they  can know  my work history in depth.As a user type, I want to make my website very easy to understand, so that when people view my website they dont have any trouble to get around and ubderstand what i deliverd in the website.
 There is also an about page which explains who i am and what i do it also has a picture of me in this section the reason o addd the picture is so that the viewer knows who i am.
##  Features
This website uses a full navigation that goes across the page horizontally only when your viewing it on a desktop and when you view it on a mobile phone the navigaton bar automatically turns in to a scroll spy, to do this i used bootstrap and a bit of jquary to smooth
it out.
##  Features Left to Implement
In the future i would like to implement a section called projects in this section i would include all my projects i have created throught my coding career, i would also add a chat box so who ever has any question about my website for me can have a chat over text with me all in my website.

###  Technologies

1. HTML this is where i put all the information that i want people who view my website to see.
2. CSS this is where i style all my html so i can attract the viewers when looking at my website
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1) i used bootstrap to get the layout that i am looking for.
4. jquary  this project uses jquary to simplyfy DOM manipulations


##  Testing
I belive that i have achived to showcase my portfolio in a ways that employers and viewers would undersatnd who i am and what i do very easily with the information that i have provided.
In the about section i have put a picture of my self so viewers can imagine what i look like while they read about me i belive this would help them understand who i am more. The picture can only be viwed on a desktop only.
On this section i also wrote two paragraphs briefly explaining who i am, my background, what i do and what i intent to achive.
In the footer i put my social media, viewers would have to click on the social media icons this would lead them to another tab 
where my social media open up in.
I put a section called CV this take you to another tab where my CV open up in employers/viewers can download my CV by clicking the document icons.

I can be contacted from the contact section where you would find a form that you can fill in. On the form if you write an invalid email you would get a small message identifying this mistake the message would say "inalid email " when filling the form out on a mobile device and you want to write your phone number it would open up a number dialing board where you can dial in your phone number
When you click on the links on he navbar the scroll spy effect would work regardless of wheather or not your viewing the section in the same order they are listed in he dropdown.

I tested this website across a few browsers (chrome, firefox, safari and internet explore), i ha also tested it on diffrent device and sizes eg;- iphone XR; Iphone 6, samsung 1 plus
ipad and a macbook pro.
the diffrent sizes i viewed it on are (ipad 768 x1024) iphone xr(375 x 814) and laptop (1280 x 800)

while i was doing the tests i relised my picture was being squashed on the mobile device so i decided to add a media query and only 
veiw the picture on a desktop, the reason i changed it was because it was not very presentable.

##  Deployment
I deployed this site directly from a master branch and i used Git hub to host it. the landing page must be index.html for it to be deployed correctly.
 to run my code locally you would have to put the following in to your terminal ;- 'git commit'  (https://ayaanh221.github.io/portfolio1/)
